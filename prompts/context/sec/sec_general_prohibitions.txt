SEC RULE 206(4)-1(a) - GENERAL PROHIBITIONS

An advertisement may not:
1. Include any untrue statement of a material fact.
2. Omit a material fact necessary to make the statement not misleading.
3. Include a material statement of fact that the adviser cannot substantiate upon demand.
4. Discuss potential benefits without fair and balanced treatment of material risks.
5. Include a reference to specific investment advice that is not fair and balanced.
6. Include information likely to cause an untrue or misleading inference.

KEY INTERPRETATIONS:
- "Universal" or "Blanket" recommendations (e.g., "suitable for everyone") are inherently misleading.
- Promissory language (e.g., "will ensure", "guarantees") is a per se violation if outcomes depend on market conditions.
- Conflicts of interest (e.g., recommending proprietary products) must be clear and not buried.
